# PiRMotion
                                                A simple code to use the PIR sensor on Arduino IDE.

The PIR sensor is a motion detector based on the detection of low level radiation. This measurement is calculated by his microcontroller, which send us a HIGH/LOW signal to know if there have been something detected.
The signal is measured by an digital pin on the Arduino. 
The connections ae simple :


Arduino               --------------------          PIR

5V                        ------------              VCC

GND                       ------------              GND

Digital Pin(5)            ------------              OUT
